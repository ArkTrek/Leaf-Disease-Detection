# Leaf Disease Detection System 🍃

This project uses machine learning algorithms to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves from images.

## Overview ℹ️

Detecting diseases in plant leaves is crucial for ensuring crop health and maximizing yield. This project employs machine learning techniques to analyze leaf images and identify common diseases, aiding farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection and management.

## Features 🚀

- **Image Classification**: Utilizes pre-trained models to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Can classify leaves into multiple disease categories for comprehensive diagnosis.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing images in real-time for immediate disease detection.
- **Customizable Models**: Allows for fine-tuning and customization of models for specific plant species or disease types.

## Installation 💻

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage 📋

1. Prepare images of plant leaves, ensuring they are clear and well-lit.
2. Run the detection script: `python detection.py`
3. View the detected disease and recommended actions.
